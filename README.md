# ClimateWars
Repo for Climate Wars, in development. Game developed in C# and on Unity.

The idea is to have a couch game where players can pick animals in humanoid forms.
These animals have different passive and active powers.
The goal is to throw at each other spawned objects for a fixed number of seconds and scoring points. A full game is played over 4 maps. 
Each map will benefit different types of animals (polar bears are better on ice maps etc.)

Point system to be defined as well as time of rounds.
